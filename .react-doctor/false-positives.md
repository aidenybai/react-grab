# Known React Doctor false-positive patterns

This file is the institutional memory the bot uses to skip diagnostics that
have already been triaged as false positives. **Edit this file freely** — the
bot reads it each run and treats every pattern below as "do not fix".

If a triage reveals a new FP pattern, append it here with: the rule id, the
shape of the code that triggers it, and a one-line reason. Be specific enough
that future runs can recognize the same pattern, not just the same file.
