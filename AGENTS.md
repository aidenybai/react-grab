- MUST: We use @antfu/ni. Use `ni` to install, `nr SCRIPT_NAME` to run script, `nun` to uninstall package
- MUST: Use TypeScript interfaces over types
- MUST: Use arrow functions over function declarations
- NEVER comment unless absolutely necessary.
  - If it is a hack, such as a setTimeout or potentially confusing code, it should be prefixed with // HACK: reason for hack
- MUST: Use kebab-case for files
- MUST: Use descriptive names for variables (avoid shorthands, or 1-2 character names).
  - Example: for .map(), you can use `innerX` instead of `x`
  - Example: instead of `moved` use `didPositionChange`
- MUST: Do not type cast ("as") unless absolutely necessary
- MUST: Keep interfaces or types on the global scope.
- MUST: Remove unused code and don't repeat yourself.
