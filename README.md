Copy elements on your app and as context for Cursor, Claude Code, etc.

By default, Cursor, Claude Code, etc. cannot access elements on your page. React Grab allows you to tell them what part of your app you want to change.

With React Grab:

- Hold <kbd>⌘C</kbd> and click on any element on your page
- Works with Cursor, Claude Code, OpenCode
- Just a single script tag (it’s just JavaScript!)
